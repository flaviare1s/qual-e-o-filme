# What's the Movie? 🎬

English | [Português](./README.md)

## 📖 About the Project

I developed this game during my first days of studying React and JavaScript. It was an enriching experience, especially using artificial intelligence to assist in game development.

As a cinema enthusiast, creating the hints was an especially fun part of the process. The game is simple yet challenging, perfect for movie lovers!

## 🎯 Game Objective

The goal of the game is to guess the movie name using the five provided hints. After each guess, a new hint will be revealed. You have a total of five attempts to guess the movie name correctly.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Read the first hint provided
2. Enter your guess in the text box
3. After each attempt, a new hint will be revealed
4. Keep trying until you guess the movie name or run out of your five attempts
5. You can skip to another movie at any time
